# rock-paper-scissors
Welcome to my first game project! This project marks my initial journey using the fundamental tools of JavaScript. The game is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of JavaScript functions.
